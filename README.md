# Scanbot SDK Integration Challenge

## Task 
Implement Barcode Scanning functionality in the given project using Scanbot Barcode SDK for Android. 

It is expected that you will use our Ready-to-Use UI Barcode Scanning feature for this challenge. 

The time starts when you open the documentation link for the first time and ends when
you scan the first barcode on a physical device connected to the laptop. 

The documentation link:
- https://docs.scanbot.io/barcode-scanner-sdk/android/quick-start/

Good luck to all!
